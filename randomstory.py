# Test of the story branching system. For each episode, the player can choose
# one path, which affects the world state and potentially triggers special
# events.

# In this case, the actions of the player inevitably lead to the discovery of
# Typhon, a mission to recover Typhon, and the final battle against Typhon.
# *Non-standard Game Over: The player becomes Typhon's pilot.
