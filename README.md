ABOUT
=====

The first scenario for GearHead Caramel is Winter Mocha. Set a few months
after the Typhon Incident, you are invited to take part in a charity mecha
tournament at the newly constructed Mauna Arena.

This is an early alpha release- there are tons of things that aren't finished
yet. However, it's a fun little scenario, and will show you some of the new
things that GearHead Caramel can do.

INSTALLATION
============

If you are installing from source, you will need both Python 2.7 and
PyGame installed.

  https://www.python.org/

  http://www.pygame.org/

Unzip the game files and put them in a convenient folder. The file you want
to run is "main.py"; with any luck you will just be able to double click that
file and the game will start. If not, try right clicking and select "open
with Python".

The first time it's run, the game will create a "ghcaramel" folder in your
home directory and place a configuration file there. This is where all of your
characters and saved games are stored, in case you want to delete them or
make backups. The configuration file can be edited in any text editor.

In fact, the entire game can be edited in any text editor. Go ahead and look at
how things work.
