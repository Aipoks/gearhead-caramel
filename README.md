ABOUT
=====

The first scenario for GearHead Caramel is Winter Mocha. Set a few months
after the Typhon Incident, you are invited to take part in a charity mecha
tournament at the newly constructed Mauna Arena.

This is an early alpha release- there are tons of things that aren't finished
yet. However, it's a fun little scenario, and will show you some of the new
things that GearHead Caramel can do.

BUILDING FROM SOURCE
====================

Things have gotten a bit more complicated since the last time I updated
this file. To build GearHead Caramel from source, first you will need to
install Python3. After that you need to install the PyGame, Numpy, and
Cython packages. The easiest way to install these is with "pip". You may
also need to install a C compiler for Cython; see the Cython page for
details.

The first time it's run, the game will create a "ghcaramel" folder in your
home directory and place a configuration file there. This is where all of your
characters and saved games are stored, in case you want to delete them or
make backups. The configuration file can be edited in any text editor.
