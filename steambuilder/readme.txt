I realized that my docker build and script for Steam isn't backed up anywhere,
so I'm adding it to the git. The file paths will need to be changed in the
"build_for_steam.sh" script. Also, you should have an already-cloned repo of
GearHead Caramel in the work folder. Hopefully this can help anyone else trying
to set up a PyGame build environment for Steam.
